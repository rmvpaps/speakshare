speakshare
==========

This is a project to create an android app speakshare that will use speakers on multiple devices together.

The idea is to generate bluetooth/wifi connections between devices and create an-adhoc network and use this network to transmit sound onto different devices. So if someone wants to setup a sudden meeting, he/she will request connections from his/her device to others and once they accept, speakers in connected devices will work as a single unit.
